# Infrastructure

Deployment templates, operational docs, and host automation live here.

- `infra/compose/` Docker Compose templates (shared + per-room stacks)
- `infra/proxy/` Reverse proxy configs (Traefik/NGINX)
- `infra/ops/` Runbooks and operational scripts (backups, restore tests, standby promotion)
